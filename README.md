Hi Gabriel Morelli here, and I am passionate about programming, currently I know about JavaScript, PHP and C#, at the moment I am learning about functional languages like F# and elixir.

I've already used nestjs to make a task API, .DOTNET Core to make backend services with angular in frondend and PHOENIX (elixir) to build a simple database API
